A new gamemode that attempts to turn regular players into a culinary masters.
On gFodder one will face various challenges as you compete head-to-head to create delicious dishes.

## How to play:
Press play, vote for a gamemode, join a team, ready up and wait for the game to start.
Use the fridge to collect ingredients, chop them up, fry them or soup them and serve to the judge.
When you want to try something different, vote to end the game via the F1 menu.

## Notes:
- Order system does not handle soup yet, but feel free to make one in freestyle mode to see how it works.
- Loot Box (opened with order points) does nothing yet, just looks pretty.
- Voting systems are primitive and do not take team balance and such into account yet.
- The versus mode is not functional yet, just freestyle cooking (not timed) and practice mode.
- Player options/settings is untested, it may save or it may not.
- There is a ton more features that are 3/4 of the way done, but they are not stable and so they are disabled for now.
