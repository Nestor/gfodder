Built to be a single-player or multi-player experience, gFodder a new style of gamemode that attempts to turn the regular player into a culinary master.
Chop, fry and boil your way to victory as you create delicious dishes using the ingredients in your trusty fridge.

## How to play:
Press play, vote for a gamemode, join a team, ready up and wait for the game to start.
Use the fridge to collect ingredients, chop them up, fry them or soup them and serve to the judge.
When you want to try something different, vote to end the game via the F1 menu.

## Notes:
- Order system does not handle soup yet, but feel free to make one in freestyle mode to see how it works.
- Loot Box (opened with order points) does nothing yet, just looks pretty.
